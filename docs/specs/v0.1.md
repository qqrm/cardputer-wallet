* Persistent storage [`sequential-storage`](https://github.com/tweedegolf/sequential-storage) on the external flash
* Message schema [`ergot`](https://github.com/jamesmunns/ergot) to derive codecs shared with the host
* Serialization [`postcard`](https://github.com/jamesmunns/postcard) for constrained device frames
* Crypto chacha20poly1305, x25519 dalek, ed25519 dalek, hkdf, hmac, sha2, blake3
* Secure memory zeroize with ZeroizeOnDrop

## 4. Trust model and crypto

* Device long term keypair X25519

  * Private key encrypted at rest with KEK from PIN using scrypt N 16384 r 8 p 1 len 32
  * Stored as AEAD with salt and scrypt params
* Vault symmetric key VK 32 bytes

  * Vault content encrypted with ChaCha20 Poly1305
  * Separate nonce per record page
* Recipients list

  * For each device store wrapped VK using X25519 KEM and HKDF SHA256
* Integrity

  * vault.enc and recips.json signed by project Ed25519 key
  * Public verify key built into firmware
* TOTP

  * RFC 6238 SHA1 default
  * Optional SHA256 and SHA512 per entry
  * Digits 6 default, 8 optional
  * Period 30 seconds default
* Randomness

  * ESP RNG as entropy source
  * DRBG for session keys
* Zeroization

  * PIN buffer, KEK, device private key, VK, per entry decrypted password, HKDF and AEAD work buffers, TOTP HMAC state are zeroized on use end and on lock

## 5. Lock and PIN policy

* PIN 6 to 12 digits
* 3 consecutive failures add exponential backoff
* 10 total failures trigger wipe flow that requires two key hold confirmation
* Auto lock on inactivity 90 seconds default configurable

## 6. Vault format on GitHub

* Files in repo root

  * vault.enc binary encrypted payload
  * recips.json wrapped VK recipients
  * vault.sig Ed25519 signature over vault.enc and recips.json and config.json if present
  * config.json optional unsigned content is rejected
* Encrypted payload content CBOR

  * version int
  * meta object

    * generation monotonically increasing int
    * created at, updated at UTC
  * entries array of entry objects
* Entry object

  * id uuid v4
  * title string
  * service string and optional domains array
  * username string
  * password stored inside the encrypted body, not visible in UI
  * totp optional object

    * secret base32 no spaces
    * algo sha1 or sha256 or sha512
    * digits 6 or 8
    * period seconds default 30
  * tags array of strings
  * macro optional string template
  * updated at utc, used at utc

## 7. Sync model

* v0.1 uses USB CDC to a host CLI for both pull and push
* Device side maintains an operation journal in RAM and encrypted at rest

  * ops add, update field wise, delete by id
* Push flow

  * Device sends journal frames over CDC
  * CLI applies to latest vault, resolves conflicts, re encrypts, updates recips if needed, signs, commits, pushes
  * Device clears local journal after ACK
* Pull flow

  * CLI fetches latest main, downloads signed artifacts, verifies signature locally, sends vault.enc and recips.json over CDC
  * Device verifies signature again, unwraps VK, decrypts vault, applies local unsynced ops if any
* Conflict policy last write wins by updated at per field
* Monotonic generation prevents rollback

## 8. Transport and HID

## 27. Roadmap

* v0.1 this spec
